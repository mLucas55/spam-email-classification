# spam-email-classification
A machine learning model that can predict if an email is spam.

* Given an email this model can predict with ~80% accuracy if it is spam.

* This neural network uses Google's BERT transformer to convert emails to vectors which are then fed into a TensorFlow functional model.

* Trained on this data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/purusinghvi/email-spam-classification-dataset/data

* The dat set used had already preprocessed the emails, but there was still some abnormalities that were fixed such as invalid substrings.

* The data set had a slight imbalance so down sampling was used.
  
* This is my first functional model which was created to continue learning about machine learning.
